	<p class="lead"> Researcher in space plasma physics & planetary science.</p>
	<p> I study the ionosphere, the most upper part of the atmosphere, which links us to space. I am interested in seeing how the ionosphere moves and on what time-scales it responds to events within the magnetosphere and in space. I do this primarily by using data from the ground-based SuperDARN (Super Dual Auroral Radar Network) radars.</p>
	<p> Other research interests include:
	 	<ul>
			<li>Solar wind driving of the magnetosphere-ionosphere-thermosphere system</li>
			<li>Auroras</li>
			<li>Electrodynamics in space</li>
			<li>Space plasma physics</li>
			<li>Space weather</li>
			<li>Magnetic fields in space</li>
			<li>Planetary science and the solar system</li>
		</ul>

	<p>Find out more about the project I currently work on the project <a href="https://mtwalach.github.io/current_project.html">Time Variability of the ionospheric electric field: solar wind driving and atmospheric feedback</a>.</p>

	<p>I am based in the <a href="https://www.lancaster.ac.uk/physics/">Lancaster University Physics Department</a> and am part of the <a href="https://www.lancaster.ac.uk/physics/research/astrophysics/space-and-planetary-physics/">Space and Planetary Physics Group</a>.
	Previously, I studied at the <a href="https://www.le.ac.uk ">University of Leicester</a>.</p>

	<p>I am available for collaborations, outreach and consultancy</span>. <a href="contact">Drop me a line</a> about your project if you're interested in working with me.</p>
