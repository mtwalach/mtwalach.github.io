	<p class="lead"> Researcher in space plasma physics & planetary science.</p>
	<p> I study the interactions between the solar wind, the magnetosphere and the ionosphere. That's our most immediate magnetic environment and the most upper part of the atmosphere, which links us to space. I am interested in the energy transport in our Terrestrial plasma environment and how it responds to events within the magnetosphere itself, and in space. I do this primarily by using data from spacecraft, and the ground-based SuperDARN (Super Dual Auroral Radar Network) radars.</p>
	<p> My research interests include:
	 	<ul>
			<li>Solar wind driving of the magnetosphere-ionosphere-thermosphere system</li>
			<li>Auroras</li>
			<li>Electrodynamics in space</li>
			<li>Space plasma physics</li>
			<li>Space weather</li>
			<li>Magnetic fields in space</li>
			<li>Interactions of the plasma environment wiht the neutral atmosphere</li>
			<li>Planetary science and the solar system</li>
		</ul>
