<p>Currently, I work on a project where we are trying to predict the Upper
Atmospheric Response to Extremes of Space Weather Forcing.</p>

<p>As part of this, I am developing TiVIE (the Time Varying Ionospheric Electric
Field Model), which is a new model for the high- to mid-latitude ionosphere.
Previous ionospheric electric field models primarily use static climatologies
but the TiVIE model also takes into account the time-varying nature of the solar
wind and other phenomena (substorms and geomagnetic storms), which add
variability to the ionospheric electric field.</p>

<p>We are working to integrate TiVIE into the most cutting-edge whole atmosphere
model (the Whole Atmospher Community Climate Model with thermosphere and
ionosphere extension or, in short: WACCM-X) to establish for the first time,
what effects time-varying space weather phenomena such as substorms and
geomagnetic storms have on the upper atmosphere.</p>
<p>This will help us to work out how sensitive the models need to be and test the
limitations, as well as bring us one step closer to predicting space weather
phenomena.</p>
